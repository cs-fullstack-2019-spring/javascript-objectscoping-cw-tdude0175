/*
the first console.log is going to record the last recorded fullname variable inside of the object it was defined.
being that it was defined inside the object it will register that fullname is "Aurelio de Rosa"
because it defaults to the last used operation as it being var it will reassign it to Aurelio de Rosa

var test is defined in the same action so it will repeat it again.
